## Project Description
#### Overview:

The idea is to implement a simple single-page application (SPA) using the vanilla JavaScript script.  
This game lets the player hit the space bar in a small frame of time, the faster he clicks, the closer to breaking previous players' record.
When the game is over it'll allow you to type your nickname, then it'll render the list of top 10 scores, otherwise, it'll ask you to play again or to go to the main page.
#### Challenges:
Nested Fetching, instead of using React, this project made sure to focus on fetching.


## Technologies
- Vanilla Javascript for the Front-end
- Rails API for the Back-end
- PostgreSQL as a backend Database-API
- Fetching data to the backend
- Plain CSS, No Frameworks
- Animate.CSS for animations

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repo
2. Cd to the backend file and do this:
   ```bash
      $cd backend
   ```
3. Inside the backend file:

   ```bash
      $rails db:reset && rails s -p 3000
   ```
4. Now you can go to the frontend file and open the ( index.html ) file

5. Enjoy the game
